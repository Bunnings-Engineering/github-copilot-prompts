## GitHub Copilot Prompts

This repo contains my collection of GitHub Copilot prompts for my personal learning and reference. I'm making this repo public in the hope that it may be useful to others.

The way this repo is structured is by _persona_:

- `app-dev` - contains prompts useful for application developers,
- `test-engineer` - contains prompts useful for test engineers,
- `infra-engineer` - contains prompts useful for infrastructure engineers,
- `ai-engineer` - contains prompts useful for AI/ML engineers,
- and so on...
